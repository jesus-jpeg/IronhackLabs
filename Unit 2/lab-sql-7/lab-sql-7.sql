### Instructions

#1. In the table actor, which are the actors whose last names are not repeated? 
#For example if you would sort the data in the table actor by last_name, you would see that there is Christian Arkoyd, Kirsten Arkoyd, and Debbie Arkoyd. 
#These three actors have the same last name. So we do not want to include this last name in our output. 
#Last name "Astaire" is present only one time with actor "Angelina Astaire", hence we would want this in our output list. 
SELECT first_name, COUNT(last_name) AS repeated_times
FROM actor
GROUP BY first_name
HAVING COUNT(last_name) = 1
ORDER BY first_name ASC;

#2. Which last names appear more than once? We would use the same logic as in the previous question but 
#this time we want to include the last names of the actors where the last name was present more than once
SELECT first_name, COUNT(last_name) AS repeated_times
FROM actor
GROUP BY first_name
HAVING COUNT(last_name) > 1
ORDER BY first_name ASC;

#3. Using the rental table, find out how many rentals were processed by each employee.
SELECT staff_id, COUNT(rental_id) AS total_rentals
FROM rental
GROUP BY staff_id;

#4. Using the film table, find out how many films were released each year.
SELECT release_year, COUNT(release_year) AS total_films
FROM film
GROUP BY release_year;

#5. Using the film table, find out for each rating how many films were there.
SELECT rating, COUNT(release_year) AS total_films
FROM film
GROUP BY rating;


#6. What is the mean length of the film for each rating type. Round off the average lengths to two decimal places 
SELECT rating, ROUND(AVG(length)) AS mean_length
FROM film
GROUP BY rating;

#7. Which kind of movies (rating) have a mean duration of more than two hours?
SELECT rating, ROUND(AVG(length)) AS mean_length
FROM film
WHERE length > 120
GROUP BY rating;
