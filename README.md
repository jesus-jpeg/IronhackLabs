# Ironhack Labs

Here you will find all the Labs I did during my 24 weeks Data Analytics Bootcamp at Ironhack.


### Unit 1 | Intro to Python

The aim of [Unit 1](https://github.com/jesus-jpeg/IronhackLabs/tree/main/Unit%201) is to set the fundamentals of Data Analysis: How to ask questions; how to interpret questions; how to read, clean, and explore data; what is Machine Learning and how can it help decision making; how to prepare the data for modeling and fit a linear model, how did I validate the model I built and why did I choose it over others (notions of "what does good look like"); what do the results mean; what is the business relevance of this analysis.

### Unit 2 | SQL

The aim of [Unit 2](https://github.com/jesus-jpeg/IronhackLabs/tree/main/Unit%202) is to learn how to extract and analyze data stored in databases: recognizing two main different types of Databases, identifying the power of SQL, understanding how to query a structured database, manipulating categorical variables, identifying data anomalies and normalizing data, gathering data from various sources, applying window functions, interpreting Entity relations diagrams (ERD) and a brief intro to classification models.

### Unit 3 | Connecting SQL and Python

The aim of [Unit 3](https://github.com/jesus-jpeg/IronhackLabs/tree/main/Unit%203) is to boost SQL skills to query complex databases: joining multiple tables, normalising databases and performing nested subqueries. We will also introduce multi class classification and the problem of class imbalance. This unit works as a continuation of the previous unit (2). The output is a classification model built using Python. The students will reinforce their understanding of the whole data process.

### Unit 4 | Machine Learning

The aim of [Unit 4](https://github.com/jesus-jpeg/IronhackLabs/tree/main/Unit%204) is to expand their comprehension of the Data Analysis toolkit and supervised Machine learning. They are going to expand their data cleaning skills with RegEx, extract features from datasets and tune a KNN approach/methodology considering the bias-variance trade-off.

We will also get introduced to Business Intelligence’s main concepts and tools.

### Unit 5 | Mid Project

The students will choose their challenge, from both algorithms we learned in the past 4 units. The project briefs are optimized for their portfolio.
For the PT format, unit 5 extends with one extra mini-project that is scheduled right after Unit 1. The aim of this mini project is to foster autonomy, project management skills, and problem-solving at an early stage in the program.

This [project](https://github.com/jesus-jpeg/patent-pending) prredicts the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated

### Unit 6 | Advanded Data Analytics

The aim of [Unit 6](https://github.com/jesus-jpeg/IronhackLabs/tree/main/Unit%206) is to boost their Data Analysis skills and consolidate advanced use of the main tech Stack: mapping and understanding the business problem, using advanced functions and detailed expression in their code, optimizing their process using stored procedures in SQL, using excel macros to automate some spreadsheet operations, and finally creating dashboards to visualize results.

### Unit 7 | Data Engineering & Statistics

The aim of [Unit 7](https://github.com/jesus-jpeg/IronhackLabs/tree/main/Unit%207) is to take students' understanding of the logic behind the engineering just one level higher! A lot of the effort in this unit is critical, deep, thinking. We’ll be introducing ensemble methods (specifically tree-based algorithms) and deal with high-dimensional datasets. An important inclusion in the ML workflow, is hypothesis testing (including ANOVA).

In this unit, the class will find opoportinities for debate, critical thinking and deep reflection.

### Unit 8 | Webscrapping & API

The aim of [Unit 8](https://github.com/jesus-jpeg/IronhackLabs/tree/main/Unit%208) is to polish their data analytics and engineering skills by performing an end-to-end data product: we will create a program that takes an input from the user and automatically collects data from the internet through web scraping and APIs; then it goes through a clustering model and finally returns an output back to the user. They will implement agile methodologies to develop the product and finally they will “sell it” with an engaging presentation


### Unit 9 | Final Project

This [project](https://github.com/jesus-jpeg/Ironhack-FinalProject/tree/main) explores the implementation of Digital Twins across various business models.

The project covers three main areas:

1. **Supply Chain Inventory Management:** Investigating the application of Digital Twins in optimizing inventory management within the supply chain.

2. **Line Production Failure Prediction:** Utilizing Digital Twins to predict and prevent failures in line production processes.

3. **Ecommerce Store Analysis:** Analyzing the effectiveness of Digital Twins in enhancing the performance of an Ecommerce store.

By examining these different aspects, this project highlights the significant role of Digital Twin deployment in today's world.
