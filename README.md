# Ironhack Labs

Here you will find all the Labs I did during my 24 weeks Data Analytics Bootcamp at Ironhack.


### Unit 1 | Intro to Python

The aim of [Unit 1](https://github.com/jesus-jpeg/Ironhack-Labs/tree/main/Unit%201) is to set the fundamentals of Data Analysis: How to ask questions; how to interpret questions; how to read, clean, and explore data; what is Machine Learning and how can it help decision making; how to prepare the data for modeling and fit a linear model, how did I validate the model I built and why did I choose it over others (notions of "what does good look like"); what do the results mean; what is the business relevance of this analysis.

### Unit 2 | SQL

The aim of [Unit 2](https://github.com/jesus-jpeg/Ironhack-Labs/tree/main/Unit%202) is to learn how to extract and analyze data stored in databases: recognizing two main different types of Databases, identifying the power of SQL, understanding how to query a structured database, manipulating categorical variables, identifying data anomalies and normalizing data, gathering data from various sources, applying window functions, interpreting Entity relations diagrams (ERD) and a brief intro to classification models.

### Unit 3 | Connecting SQL and Python

The aim of [Unit 3](https://github.com/jesus-jpeg/Ironhack-Labs/tree/main/Unit%203) is to boost SQL skills to query complex databases: joining multiple tables, normalising databases and performing nested subqueries. We will also introduce multi class classification and the problem of class imbalance. This unit works as a continuation of the previous unit (2). The output is a classification model built using Python. The students will reinforce their understanding of the whole data process.

### Unit 4 | Machine Learning

The aim of [Unit 4](https://github.com/jesus-jpeg/Ironhack-Labs/tree/main/Unit%204) is to expand their comprehension of the Data Analysis toolkit and supervised Machine learning. They are going to expand their data cleaning skills with RegEx, extract features from datasets and tune a KNN approach/methodology considering the bias-variance trade-off.

We will also get introduced to Business Intelligenceâ€™s main concepts and tools.
